Product Manager makes the decisions of the software products. Engineers don't have an option to do that, they are just like infantry units - Power to execute.
Start seeing softwares in terms of products and not only in terms of Programming languages or technologies.
Engineers are paid for their ability to make the computer do things, complexity handling and meeting deadlines with quality.
Product Managers are paid for gap analysis which adds business value.
Sales is a life skill. I need to know Sales. I can't sell a thing or talk a thing about selling. I need to know it as soon as possible to be able to sell anything under the sun.
